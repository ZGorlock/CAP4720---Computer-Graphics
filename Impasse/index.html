			<b>IMPASSE</b>

				Impasse is a game played on a checkers set that was invented by Mark Steere.<br>
				For detailed instructions see: <a href="http://www.marksteeregames.com/Impasse_rules.pdf">Detailed Rules</a>
			</p>
			<hr>
			<p>
				There are three basic moves:
				<ul>
					<li>Slides:        Moving one of your single pieces away from you</li>
					<li>Double Slides: Moving one of your double pieces towards you</li>
					<li>Transposes:    Moving a piece from a double to a single that is closer to you and adjacent to the double</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>
				If you move a single to the far side of the board, you must crown it with one of your other singles, turning it into a double.<br>
				If you a move a double to the near side of the board, you bear-off the crown and remove the piece from play.<br>
				If you have no basic moves available you are at an Impasse, and you may remove any single piece from play or turn any double into a single.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>
				The first person to remove all their pieces from play wins.<br>
				Good luck!
